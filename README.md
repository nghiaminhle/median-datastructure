# median-datastructure
Building a data structure to store a set of number for getting median easily

Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

- void addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data structure.

- double findMedian() - Return the median of all elements so far.

For example:

addNum(1)

addNum(2)

findMedian() -> 1.5

addNum(3) 

findMedian() -> 2
